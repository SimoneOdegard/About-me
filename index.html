        Hi! I'm Simone Odegard. I grew up in Maple Valley, WA and I am currently living in Renton, WA. I graduated from the University of Washington in 2012 with a BA in Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. I am currently a dance teacher and coach a competitive dance team. Before that, I used to work at Sanmar in sales and service as well at different property locations as an apartment manager. My goal is to have a successful career as a software developer.
