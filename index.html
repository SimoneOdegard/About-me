    <p>
        <img src="selfie.jpg"> Hi! I'm Simone Odegard. I grew up in Maple Valley, WA and I am currently living in Renton, WA. My favorite color is pink and I love all things cute.
    </p>

    <p>
        I graduated from the University of Washington in 2012 with a BA in Interdisciplinary Arts and Sciences. I am currently a dance teacher and coach a competitive dance team. Before that, I used to work at Sanmar as an Account Coordinator specializing in sales and service. I have also worked at different property locations as an apartment manager.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to have a successful career as a software developer! I am currently a student at Code Fellows and on track to graduate June 2021.
